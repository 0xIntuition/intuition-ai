# Intuition Whitepaper - AI-Optimized Versions

This repository contains AI-optimized versions of the [Intuition Protocol Whitepaper](https://github.com/0xIntuition/intuition-whitepaper/blob/main/intuition_whitepaper.pdf). The goal is to make the protocol specification more accessible and actionable for AI agents while providing both faithful representation and implementation guidance.

   - Optimized for both human and machine consumption

2. **`llms_extended.txt`**: Implementation Guide
   - Technical specifications and interfaces
   - Mathematical formulas and calculations
   - Implementation patterns and examples
   - Agent integration guidelines
   - Economic models and computations
