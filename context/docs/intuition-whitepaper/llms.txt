# Intuition: The Trust Protocol

> A decentralized system for reputation, trust, and decision-making in P2P systems. The Intuition protocol addresses the critical challenge of continued reliance on social consensus and trust in decentralized systems by creating a semantic, transparent, open, and verifiable framework for trust computation.

## Abstract

The Intuition protocol introduces a novel approach to trust and reputation in decentralized systems. By leveraging semantic data structures, economic incentives, and transparent computation, it enables the creation of verifiable trust relationships between participants. The protocol's architecture supports both human and machine actors, facilitating the evolution of more trustful digital interactions.

## Introduction

### Context and Motivation

The evolution of the web has highlighted a fundamental challenge: the continued reliance on subjective, human-centric trust mechanisms. While decentralized technologies have made significant progress in creating 'trustless' systems, many layers of interaction still require trust. The Intuition protocol addresses this by creating a more 'trustful' interaction layer.

### Problem Statement

Despite advancements in trustless systems, key challenges remain:
- Reliance on social consensus
- Need for human trust in critical decisions
- Lack of structured trust computation
- Limited interoperability of trust signals

### Solution Overview

Intuition reimagines how data is:
- Expressed through atomic units
- Structured using semantic relationships
- Refined through economic incentives
- Monetized via stake-weighted signals
