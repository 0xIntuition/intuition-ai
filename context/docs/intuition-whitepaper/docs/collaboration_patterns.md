# Human-AI Collaboration Patterns

This document outlines patterns for effective collaboration between humans and AI agents when working with the Intuition Protocol.

## Interaction Models

### Basic Pattern

```typescript
interface CollaborationContext {
  protocol_state: ProtocolState;
  interaction_history: InteractionEvent[];
  trust_relationships: TrustGraph;
  current_focus: Topic;
}

interface InteractionPattern {
  type: 'clarification' | 'verification' | 'proposal' | 'implementation';
  initiator: 'human' | 'ai';
  context: CollaborationContext;
  expected_outcome: OutcomeType;
}
```

## Common Scenarios

### 1. Protocol Implementation

```
Human: Expresses high-level goal or requirement
AI: Analyzes requirement and suggests implementation approach
Human: Reviews and provides feedback
AI: Refines approach based on feedback
Both: Verify implementation meets requirements
```

### 2. Trust Assessment

```
AI: Analyzes trust signals and patterns
Human: Provides context and domain knowledge
AI: Adjusts calculations based on context
Human: Validates against intuition/experience
Both: Agree on trust assessment
```

### 3. Governance Decisions

```
Human: Expresses intent or concern
AI: Analyzes impact and implications
Human: Refines position based on analysis
AI: Formalizes proposal with specifics
Both: Participate in governance process
```

## Resolution Patterns

### Ambiguity Resolution

```typescript
async function resolveAmbiguity(
  context: CollaborationContext,
  ambiguity: AmbiguityType
): Promise<Resolution> {
  if (ambiguity.type === 'technical') {
    return await requestTechnicalClarification(context);
  } else if (ambiguity.type === 'intent') {
    return await clarifyUserIntent(context);
  }
}
```

### Verification Loops

```typescript
async function verifyUnderstanding(
  context: CollaborationContext,
  proposal: Proposal
): Promise<VerificationResult> {
  const humanVerification = await requestHumanVerification(proposal);
  const aiAnalysis = await analyzeProposal(proposal);
  return reconcileViewpoints(humanVerification, aiAnalysis);
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Communication

- Use explicit references to protocol concepts
- Verify understanding frequently
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain shared context

### 2. Trust Building

- Start with small, verifiable actions
- Build trust incrementally
- Document successful collaborations
- Learn from interaction history

### 3. Error Recovery

- Identify misunderstandings early
- Have clear rollback procedures
- Maintain audit trails
- Learn from mistakes

### 4. Continuous Improvement

- Gather interaction metrics
- Analyze collaboration patterns
- Refine communication methods
- Update best practices

## Example Workflows

### Implementation Project

1. Human defines project scope
2. AI analyzes requirements
3. Human validates understanding
4. AI proposes implementation plan
5. Human reviews and approves
6. AI implements with checkpoints
7. Both verify results

### Protocol Enhancement

1. Human identifies improvement area
2. AI analyzes impact
3. Human provides additional context
4. AI develops detailed proposal
5. Human reviews and refines
6. Both participate in governance
7. AI helps implement if approved

## Metrics and Evaluation

### Success Indicators

- Clear understanding achieved
- Goals accomplished effectively
- Minimal misunderstandings
- Efficient resolution of issues
- Growing trust relationship
- Improved collaboration over time

### Warning Signs

- Frequent misunderstandings
- Unclear decision rationale
- Incomplete documentation
- Lack of verification
- Diminishing trust
- Repeated errors
