## Conclusion

The addition of `llms_extended.txt` significantly enhances the overall documentation effectiveness. The clear separation between conceptual understanding and technical implementation provides a more structured approach to both learning and implementing the Intuition protocol. The semantic markers and technical specifications make the documentation particularly effective for AI agents, while maintaining human readability.

The combined documentation structure now provides:

1. Clear conceptual foundation (`llms.txt`)
2. Detailed technical specifications (`llms_extended.txt`)
3. Strong machine readability
4. Comprehensive implementation guidance
5. Effective collaboration patterns

This improved structure better serves both human developers and AI agents, facilitating more effective protocol implementation and integration.
