# Welcome to the Intuition AI Repository

This repository serves as a central knowledge base for working effectively with AI agents, curated by the Intuition team. Our goal is to collect, curate, and share our growing AI resources as we develop and dogfood them based on our own emerging use cases.

## Repository Structure

### üìÅ Context

The `context/` directory contains foundational documents and real-world examples that provide essential context for AI interactions:

- `docs/`: Official documentation, whitepapers, and comprehensive guides
- `examples/`: Curated successful conversations and interactions with AI agents, annotated with insights

### üìÅ Playbooks

The `playbooks/` directory contains structured guides and rulesets:

- `cursor/`: Cursor-specific rulesets and configurations
- `workflows/`: Step-by-step guides for common AI workflows and tasks

### üìÅ Prompts

The `prompts/` directory houses effective prompting strategies and examples:

- `templates/`: Reusable prompt templates for common scenarios
- `examples/`: Real-world examples of successful prompts, organized by use case

## Usage Guide

### For Intuition Team Members (Let's Start Testing!)

1. Use this repository as your primary reference for AI interactions
2. Contribute your successful contexts, playbooks, and prompts
3. Document both successes and failures to help improve our collective knowledge

### For External Users (Coming Soon)

1. **Direct Reference**: Point AI agents to specific files or directories in this repository
2. **Cursor Integration**: Add this repository to your Cursor workspace for direct access to contexts and playbooks
3. **Template Usage**: Adapt our prompt templates and playbooks for your specific needs

## Contributing

We maintain this repository with a "dogfood first" approach:

1. We test and refine resources internally
2. We document our learnings and iterations
3. We share proven patterns with the broader community

## Evolution

This repository is designed to evolve with our understanding of AI interactions. We encourage:

- Regular updates based on new learnings
- Documentation of emerging patterns
- Community feedback and contributions

**Note**: This is a living repository. The structure and content will evolve as we discover more effective ways to work with AI agents and share our knowledge.
